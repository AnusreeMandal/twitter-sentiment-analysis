# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
-A machine learning project to analyze the sentiment of Twitter posts using Logistic Regression.
## Overview
This Project uses logistic regression to classify the Tweets as positive, negative or neutral. It demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques and natural language processing(NLP) to classify and interpret text data.

Dataset Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140) 

## Technologies Used: 

* Python

* Libraries  : numpy, pandas, re, nltk, sklearn

* NLP tools : PorterStemmer, TfidVectorizer

## Features:

* Sentiment Analysis of the tweets

* Preprocessing using NLP- includes stopword removal, stemming, and vectorization

* Evaluation with accuracy score and confusion matrix

## Methodology

* PREPROCESSING STEPS:
  
     *Text cleaning

     *Stopword removal

     *Stemming (using PorterStemmer)

     *Vectorization(using TfidVectorizer)
  
* Machine Learning Model:

      *Data Splitting into training and test data 

      *Logistic Regression to train the model

## Result

 * Accuracy for Test Data: 77.8%
   For training data:80.38%     (since there was no major difference in the accuracy score of the training and testing data no overfitting was required)
